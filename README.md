**Little Piggy Tracker** (f.k.a _'LittleGPTracker'_) is a music tracker optimised to run on portable game consoles. It is currently running on Windows, MacOS (intel/arm) & Linux, PSP, Miyoo Mini, and a collection of other retro gaming handhelds.

It implements the user interface of [littlesounddj](https://www.littlesounddj.com/lsd/index.php) and precedes [M8 tracker](https://www.dirtywave.com), two famous trackers that have been tried and tested by many users over the years, leading to a straight forward and efficent way of working.

All versions are available for free under the [GPLv3 License](LICENSE). If you like the project and want to contribute, don't hesitate to join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/e4N2VM7sz6) or make a pull request for this repo.
