**Little Piggy Tracker** (f.k.a _'LittleGPTracker'_) is a music tracker optimised to run on portable game consoles. It is currently running on Windows, MacOS (intel/arm) & Linux, PSP, Miyoo Mini, and a collection of other retro gaming handhelds.

It implements the user interface of [littlesounddj](https://www.littlesounddj.com/lsd/index.php) and precedes [M8 tracker](https://www.dirtywave.com), two popular trackers greatly loved in the tracker community.

All versions are available for free under the [GPLv3 License](LICENSE). If you like the project and want to contribute, don't hesitate to make a pull request for this repo.

* **Soundfont library is currently not ported for 64bit OS**
* **MIDI functionality __greatly__ depends on kernel support, please feature request your favourite OS maintainer =)**
* **Install ffmpeg by following install instructions for your platform [here](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)**
* **PrintFX requires toolchain support of ffmpeg libs, for all targets marked maybe contact the maintainer of your consoles toolchain**
