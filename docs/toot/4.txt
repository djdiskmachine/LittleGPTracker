Let's now learn to create new material. Let's go to the end of the song and position ourself on an empty slot.
To create a new empty chain, tap twice the A button. This will fill the slot with the first empty chain number.
We can now enter the chain and create a new phrase using the same principle, hitting A twice and enter the empty phrase.

To enter a note, simply press A in the first row of dashes. This will enter a note (C 3) and associate it to an instrument. The instrument is the number right next to the note, in this case zero.

Editing values in Little G P Tracker uses always the same principle. Simply go to the item you would like to change an hit the A button and the arrows simultaneously. Using A and right will increment the value, A and left will decrement it and up and down will increase or decrease the value in bigger chunk. For example, changing the note by hitting twice A and left will change it to D 3. Hitting now A and up will change the note one octave up to D 4.

The same can be done on the instrument field to change the instrument by increment of 1, using left and right or by increment of 10 using up and down.

To delete a note, press simultaneously A and B. This is also something that will be used across the whole software.

Once your phrase is completed, you can go back to the chain and add a new one. Enter a new set of notes. And so on. Until you are happy with it.

Then you might want to go back to the song screen and create a new chain. Either under the existing one, if it is a continuation of the sequence or next to it if you are planning on doing a new layer in the arrangment.
