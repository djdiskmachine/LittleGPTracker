Install contents of zip in a folder of your memory stick or PPSSPP folder

IMPORTANT!
If using PPSSPP, Little Piggy Tracker will start up with a black screen
Workaround:
        Before starting the app:
        Enable software rendering (might be slow)
    Or
        After starting the app:
        Go to settings and change screen resolution
        Then, save state
        Load your save state when picking up Piggy the next time

Enjoy!
